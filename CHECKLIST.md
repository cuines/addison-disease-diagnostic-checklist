# Addison's Disease Diagnostic Checklist

A comprehensive, evidence-based checklist for the diagnosis of Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency). This checklist is intended for clinical use by endocrinologists, internists, and trainees.

## Section 1: Clinical Suspicion (Key Signs & Symptoms)

### Common Symptoms
- [ ] Fatigue, generalized weakness, malaise
- [ ] Anorexia, unintentional weight loss
- [ ] Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
- [ ] Salt craving
- [ ] Postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension
- [ ] Myalgias, arthralgias

### Physical Examination Findings
- [ ] Hyperpigmentation (especially sun-exposed areas, palmar creases, buccal mucosa, recent scars)
- [ ] Hypotension (systolic BP < 100 mmHg)
- [ ] Vitiligo (associated autoimmune condition)
- [ ] Loss of axillary/pubic hair in women (due to decreased adrenal androgens)
- [ ] Scant body hair in men

### Precipitating Factors
- [ ] Recent infection, surgery, or other physiologic stress
- [ ] Withdrawal of glucocorticoid therapy
- [ ] Known autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis, etc.)

## Section 2: Initial Biochemical Evaluation

### First-Line Tests
- [ ] **Morning serum cortisol** (between 8-9 AM)
  - Interpretation:
    - Cortisol < 3 µg/dL (83 nmol/L) → highly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency
    - Cortisol > 18 µg/dL (500 nmol/L) → makes adrenal insufficiency unlikely
    - Intermediate values require dynamic testing
- [ ] **Plasma ACTH**
  - Interpretation:
    - ACTH elevated (> 2x upper limit of normal) → primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease)
    - ACTH low/normal in the context of low cortisol → secondary adrenal insufficiency
- [ ] **Serum electrolytes**
  - Hyponatremia (Na < 135 mmol/L)
  - Hyperkalemia (K > 5.0 mmol/L)
  - Hypercalcemia (mild)
- [ ] **Random blood glucose** (may show hypoglycemia)

### Additional Baseline Labs
- [ ] Complete blood count (may show eosinophilia, lymphocytosis)
- [ ] Renal function (BUN, creatinine)
- [ ] Liver function tests
- [ ] TSH and free T4 (screen for associated autoimmune thyroid disease)

## Section 3: Confirmatory Dynamic Testing

### Standard Short Synacthen (ACTH) Stimulation Test
- [ ] **Preparation:**
  - Perform in the morning (8-9 AM)
  - Patient should be fasting overnight
  - Avoid glucocorticoid medications prior to test (consult protocol)
- [ ] **Procedure:**
  1. Draw baseline cortisol (and possibly ACTH) sample.
  2. Administer 250 µg synthetic ACTH (cosyntropin) IV or IM.
  3. Draw repeat cortisol samples at 30 and 60 minutes post-injection.
- [ ] **Interpretation:**
  - **Normal response:** Peak cortisol ≥ 18 µg/dL (500 nmol/L) AND increase ≥ 9 µg/dL (250 nmol/L) from baseline.
  - **Adrenal insufficiency:** Peak cortisol < 18 µg/dL (500 nmol/L).
  - **Note:** In patients with recent onset (< 2 weeks) of secondary adrenal insufficiency, the test may be normal; clinical judgment required.

### Special Considerations
- [ ] **Patients on estrogen therapy** (including oral contraceptives, hormone replacement):
  - Estrogen increases cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), leading to elevated total cortisol measurements that may falsely appear normal.
  - **Recommendations:**
    - If available, measure **free cortisol** by equilibrium dialysis (gold standard) or **salivary cortisol** (reflects free cortisol and is CBG-independent).
    - If only total cortisol is measured, consider using a lower cutoff (e.g., peak cortisol ≥ 15 µg/dL [414 nmol/L] may be sufficient) or interpret with caution.
    - Discontinuation of estrogen for 4‑6 weeks before testing (if clinically safe) can eliminate CBG interference.
  - **Note:** The same considerations apply to other high‑CBG states (e.g., pregnancy, hepatitis, certain medications).
- [ ] **Critical illness:** Standard cut-offs may not apply; use clinical context.
- [ ] **Pregnancy:** Reference ranges differ; consult pregnancy-specific guidelines.

## Section 4: Etiological Workup

### Autoimmune Adrenalitis (Most Common Cause in Developed Countries)
- [ ] **21‑Hydroxylase antibodies** (most specific)
- [ ] **Adrenal cortex antibodies**
- [ ] Screen for other autoimmune endocrine disorders:
  - Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO)
  - Islet cell antibodies (ICA), GAD65 (if diabetes present)
  - Intrinsic factor antibodies (if pernicious anemia suspected)

### Infectious Causes
- [ ] **Tuberculosis:** PPD or IGRA, chest X‑ray, sputum culture if indicated
- [ ] **HIV:** HIV serology, viral load
- [ ] **Fungal infections** (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis) in endemic areas

### Infiltrative Disorders
- [ ] **Adrenal imaging** (CT abdomen with adrenal protocol):
  - Autoimmune adrenalitis: small, atrophic adrenals
  - Tuberculosis, fungal infection, metastases: enlarged, calcified, or heterogeneous adrenals
  - **Consider whole-body FDG‑PET** if malignancy suspected

### Genetic Causes
- [ ] **Adrenoleukodystrophy** (especially in males):
  - Very long‑chain fatty acids (VLCFA) assay
  - ABCD1 gene sequencing
- [ ] **Familial glucocorticoid deficiency** (rare)
- [ ] **Triple A syndrome** (Allgrove syndrome): achalasia, alacrima, adrenal insufficiency

### Medication‑Induced
- [ ] Review for drugs that can cause adrenal insufficiency:
  - Ketoconazole, etomidate, fluconazole
  - Rifampicin (accelerates cortisol metabolism)
  - Phenytoin, phenobarbital
  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ipilimumab, nivolumab, etc.)

## Section 5: Management Considerations at Diagnosis

### Immediate Management (if adrenal crisis suspected)
- [ ] Draw cortisol and ACTH **before** administering glucocorticoids (if feasible).
- [ ] Administer **hydrocortisone** 100‑200 mg IV bolus, then 50‑100 mg IV q6‑8h or continuous infusion.
- [ ] Provide **IV 0.9% NaCl** with dextrose if hypoglycemic.
- [ ] Monitor electrolytes, blood glucose, vital signs.

### Long‑Term Replacement Therapy
- [ ] **Glucocorticoid:** Hydrocortisone 15‑25 mg/day in 2‑3 divided doses, or prednisone 5‑7.5 mg/day.
- [ ] **Mineralocorticoid:** Fludrocortisone 0.05‑0.2 mg/day; titrate based on blood pressure, electrolytes, plasma renin activity.
- [ ] **Androgen replacement** (in women with decreased libido, fatigue): DHEA 25‑50 mg/day (off‑label, consider shared decision‑making).

### Patient Education
- [ ] **Sick‑day rules:** Double or triple glucocorticoid dose during febrile illness, trauma, surgery.
- [ ] **Emergency injection kit:** Prescribe hydrocortisone injection (Solu‑Cortef) for home use; teach IM administration.
- [ ] **Medical alert identification:** Wear bracelet/necklace stating "adrenal insufficiency" and "requires steroids in emergency".

## Section 6: Follow‑Up and Monitoring

### Routine Follow‑Up
- [ ] Clinical assessment of fatigue, weight, blood pressure, hyperpigmentation every 3‑6 months initially.
- [ ] **Laboratory monitoring:**
  - Electrolytes, renal function
  - Plasma renin activity (to guide fludrocortisone dosing)
  - Bone density scan (DEXA) after 1‑2 years of glucocorticoid therapy
- [ ] **Adjust therapy** based on clinical and biochemical response.

### Special Situations
- [ ] **Pregnancy:** Increase hydrocortisone dose by 20‑50% in third trimester; plan for stress‑dose steroids during labor.
- [ ] **Surgery:** Administer stress‑dose steroids (hydrocortisone 50‑100 mg IV q6‑8h during and 24‑48h after major surgery).
